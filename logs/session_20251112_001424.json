Introduction  \n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is broadly described as **\u201cthe capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem\u2011solving, perception, and decision\u2011making.\u201d** (Wikipedia)  \nThis definition captures the core idea that AI systems go beyond rigid, deterministic rule\u2011based programming; they can adapt, infer, and act in ways that resemble human cognition.  \n\nThe rest of this document expands on that definition by exploring:  \n\n1. The historical roots and evolution of AI.  \n2. The core concepts that underpin AI research and practice.  \n3. The major sub\u2011fields that constitute the discipline.  \n4. Key applications that demonstrate AI\u2019s impact across industries.  \n5. Current challenges that limit broader adoption and raise ethical concerns.  \n6. Future prospects and research directions that promise to shape the next decade.  \n\nBecause the provided context is limited to a single definition, many sections will be prefaced with **\u201cBased on general knowledge\u2026\u201d** to indicate that the following information is not sourced directly from the supplied text.  \n\n---\n\n## 2.  History of Artificial Intelligence  \n\n**Based on general knowledge\u2026**  \n\n| Era | Milestones | Impact |\n|-----|------------|--------|\n| **1950s \u2013 1960s: Foundations** | \u2022 1950 \u2013 Alan Turing publishes *\u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence\u201d*, introducing the Turing Test.<br>\u2022 1956 \u2013 Dartmouth Conference, coined \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d by John McCarthy and colleagues. | Established AI as an academic discipline and set the first research agenda. |\n| **1970s \u2013 1980s: Symbolic AI & Expert Systems** | \u2022 Development of rule\u2011based expert systems (e.g., MYCIN for medical diagnosis).<br>\u2022 Introduction of knowledge representation languages like LISP, Prolog. | Demonstrated that computers could encode domain expertise, leading to early commercial AI products. |\n| **1990s: Machine Learning Emergence** | \u2022 Algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and early neural networks gain traction.<br>\u2022 1997 \u2013 IBM\u2019s Deep Blue defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov. | Shifted focus from handcrafted rules to data\u2011driven learning. |\n| **2000s \u2013 2010s: Big Data & Deep Learning** | \u2022 Explosion of digital data and powerful GPUs enable deep neural networks.<br>\u2022 2012 \u2013 AlexNet wins ImageNet challenge, sparking a surge in computer vision research.<br>\u2022 2016 \u2013 AlphaGo defeats Go champion Lee Sedol. | Established deep learning as the dominant paradigm for perception and pattern recognition. |\n| **2020s: Generative Models & LLMs** | \u2022 Large\u2011scale language models (LLMs) such as GPT\u20113, GPT\u20114, and others demonstrate remarkable language understanding and generation. | AI becomes mainstream in consumer products, business automation, and creative industries. |\n\n> *Note: The above timeline synthesizes widely accepted historical facts from mainstream AI literature but is not directly cited from the supplied Wikipedia excerpt.*\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Core Concepts of AI  \n\n**Based on general knowledge\u2026**  \n\n| Concept | Description | Typical Techniques |\n|---------|-------------|--------------------|\n| **Learning** | The ability of a system to improve performance over time by extracting patterns from data. | Supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning. |\n| **Reasoning** | The process of drawing inferences or conclusions from known facts or rules. | Logic programming, probabilistic graphical models. |\n| **Perception** | Interpreting sensory input (vision, sound, touch) to form a coherent internal representation. | Convolutional neural networks, signal processing. |\n| **Decision\u2011Making** | Selecting actions that maximize expected utility or achieve a defined goal. | Markov decision processes, policy gradients. |\n| **Planning** | Sequencing actions to reach a goal while navigating constraints. | A* search, Monte Carlo tree search. |\n| **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** | Understanding and generating human language. | Transformers, recurrent neural networks. |\n| **Robotics** | Integrating perception, reasoning, and actuation for physical interaction. | Sensor fusion, motion planning. |\n\nThese concepts are not mutually exclusive; many AI systems combine several of them. For example, autonomous vehicles employ perception (computer vision), reasoning (traffic rule inference), and decision\u2011making (path planning).\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Major Sub\u2011Fields of AI  \n\n**Based on general knowledge\u2026**  \n\n1. **Machine Learning (ML)** \u2013 Algorithms that learn from data.  \n   *Sub\u2011domains:* supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi\u2011supervised learning, reinforcement learning, transfer learning, meta\u2011learning.  \n\n2. **Computer Vision** \u2013 Enabling machines to interpret visual data.  \n   *Key topics:* image classification, object detection, segmentation, 3D reconstruction.  \n\n3. **Natural Language Processing (N",
